  - name: createAlertFromJAMFProtect
    version: 1.0.0
    description: Ingests alerts from JAMF Protect. Extracts analytic details, host and user information, MITRE ATT&CK tags,
      and file/path data. The function constructs a TheHive alert, including a title, markdown-formatted description (with
      original alert JSON), relevant observables (IP, hostname, file, hash, URL, FQDN, URI path, user agent), MITRE ATT&CK
      enrichment, and a link to the JAMF alert. Handles default values and supports tagging and mapping of MITRE tactics for
      easier triage and investigation. For the setup in JAMF Protect, go to Configuration > Actions > *your action* > Add
      an HTTP data endpoint + your Authorization Header and Bearer as value
    kind: function
