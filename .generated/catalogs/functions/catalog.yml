- name: automatedIgnoreSimilarityForNoisyObservables
  version: 1.0.0
  description: This function is intended to be triggered on ObservableCreated events. It automatically sets ignoreSimilarity
    to true for observables matching a known list of common, noisy, or non-actionable values (such as localhost, private IPs,
    and generic hostnames..). This reduces alert noise and avoids false correlation in TheHive. Note that it is a workaround,
    and such issues are better managed in your alert ingestion pipeline(s)

- name: createAlertFromJAMFProtect
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Ingests alerts from JAMF Protect. Extracts analytic details, host and user information, MITRE ATT&CK tags,
    and file/path data. The function constructs a TheHive alert, including a title, markdown-formatted description (with original
    alert JSON), relevant observables (IP, hostname, file, hash, URL, FQDN, URI path, user agent), MITRE ATT&CK enrichment,
    and a link to the JAMF alert. Handles default values and supports tagging and mapping of MITRE tactics for easier triage
    and investigation. For the setup in JAMF Protect, go to Configuration > Actions > *your action* > Add an HTTP data endpoint
    + your Authorization Header and Bearer as value
